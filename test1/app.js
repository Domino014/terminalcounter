/*
Descending String Interval in the Terminal
Goal:
Develop a small script using JavaScript
and have the output display in a terminal window using Node.
Assignment:
Now that you have Node installed, you're able to execute and display the output of your JavaScript
programs within the terminal window.
For this assignment, write a program that will
countdown from 10. Instead of using actual numbers
for the countdown, have the output display a
string consisting of asterisk marks, corresponding to the number in the countdown. Each countdown tick should be displayed on a new line.
For example, if the countdown is at 5, there s
hould be five asterisk marks *****.
This probably sounds a little confusing,
so here is an example of what the final d
isplay should look like ðŸ˜„

The countdown should start from 10.
Each countdown tick should be on a new line.
Instead of numbers, the countdown tick should consist of asterisk marks.
